[Keras](https://keras.io/) is a high level deep learning API that helps quickly build neural networks via a modular approach. Keras is built on top of [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), which provides support for training on CPU or GPU. With Keras, users can design and iterate on machine learning ideas, moving from experiments to production very quickly.

In this tutorial, we're going to build, train, and evaluate some deep learning classifiers in the context of Computer Vision with the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), a collection of images that can be classified into different categories based on type.

The `CIFAR-10` data set is one of the more well known classification problems in machine learning, similar to doing descriptive statistics with the titanic dataset. `CIFAR-10` contains 60000 32 Ã— 32 pixel color images in 10 separate classes, with 6000 images per class. For training and testing, the set contains 50000 training images and 10000 in the test/validation image set.
